# Portfolio Template

### Hi, this is a template which you can use for quickly building your portfolio!

Just follow next few steps:

- **Step 1** : Clone the repo
- **Step 2**: Add some information about yourself
  - Update `docs/education.js` to add information about your education history
  - Update `docs/project.js` to add information about the projects you have done
  - Update `docs/work.js` to add information about you work history
  - Update `about.html` to add some information about yourself (hint: skills/hobbies/goals)
  - Update `intro.html` to give a very brief and crisp intro about yourself. (hint: I recommend adding links to your social profiles here)
- **Step 3**: Add your resume in the pdf format under `docs` folder with file name as `resume.pdf`

Voila! That's all you need to do :)
